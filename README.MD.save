this week we learned how to copy documents into and out of putty.
 i still find putty hard to use so im kind of worried on how ill work
 with reviel.js. overall i think i need to memorize and commit to hearty
 the commands for putty, it would be very helpful if you could post a list
 of the commands so we could study them.

this week i began my research into revieal.js to make the presentation
 for my riot shield. I also looked up the necessary parts needed to make a
 wood prototype. In this i also looked at some major flaws of modern riot
 technology. I also found encrypted messages so ill be using that to
 communicate from now on.

Sir, this week I relearned algorithms and all the other things we did in
 computer fundamentals 1. We relearned binary so i plan on reciting secret
 small messages in binary to friends just to confuse them. I looked into
 reveal.js and it does not look like fun but i will be using it for my google
 Friday project. I was thinking my project would be on something
 I'm passionate about so I will most likely be attempting to make a working
 prototype. (A.K.A a riot shield or some sort of military item.)

Sir, this week was just a review. I would dare say the most beneficial thing
 we went over for me was the sorting algorithms. other than that I've been
 thinking up a google Friday project. I am very nervous as its a big part of
 our grade.
