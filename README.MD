this week I learned not to get really angry about little things. for example
getting mad at a project that we had 3 days to do. This week i think peoplke lost there minds a little to much.
OVerall it think we should take it easy. we have a month left of school.

This week I unfortunetly struggeled with the pizza project. overall im not
enjoying this class, i onlt tookit because I thought I had to. I was 
in the box on thursday so I didnt learn to much about python.
I talked to a close friend of mine who said codeing in python is hard.
Progress on the google friday project is going well.

this week i did some research on riot shields. i found that it cant be made
of polomer and metal at the sametime. the polimer will ment when the medal
gets hot. therefore its ether one of the other. etherway you cant have polimer on the outside or inside. you can have 2 layers of medal and 1
 of polimer however. (ex. medal, polimer, medal)

this week we learned how to copy documents into and out of putty.
 i still find putty hard to use so im kind of worried on how ill work
 with reviel.js. overall i think i need to memorize and commit to hearty
 the commands for putty, it would be very helpful if you could post a list
 of the commands so we could study them.

this week i began my research into revieal.js to make the presentation
 for my riot shield. I also looked up the necessary parts needed to make a
 wood prototype. In this i also looked at some major flaws of modern riot
 technology. I also found encrypted messages so ill be using that to
 communicate from now on.

Sir, this week I relearned algorithms and all the other things we did in
 computer fundamentals 1. We relearned binary so i plan on reciting secret
 small messages in binary to friends just to confuse them. I looked into
 reveal.js and it does not look like fun but i will be using it for my google
 Friday project. I was thinking my project would be on something
 I'm passionate about so I will most likely be attempting to make a working
 prototype. (A.K.A a riot shield or some sort of military item.)

Sir, this week was just a review. I would dare say the most beneficial thing
 we went over for me was the sorting algorithms. other than that I've been
 thinking up a google Friday project. I am very nervous as its a big part of
 our grade.
